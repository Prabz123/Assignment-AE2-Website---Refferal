					<p>The Second World War (World War 2) lasted from 1939 to 1945. It was fought in Europe, 
					in Russia, North Africa and in Asia. 60 million people died in World War 2. About 40 
					million were civilians. Children as well as adults were affected by the war. The British 
					government knew that Germany would target London in their bombing raids. If the capital 
					was put out of action, it would severely affect the war effort and have a devastating 
					impact on the nation’s morale. The Blitz on London from September 1940 to May 1941 and the V1 
					flying bomb and V2 rocket attacks in 1944 caused a massive amount of damage. It is estimated
					that more than 12,000 metric tons of bombs were dropped on London and nearly 30,000 civilians
					were killed by enemy action. The worst hit places tended to be the poorer districts, like the
					East End, but all Londoners were affected by German air raids to a varying degree. </p>

					<p>A fire started on September 2nd 1666 in the King's bakery in Pudding Lane near 
					London Bridge. Fires were quite a common occurrence in those days and were soon quelled. 
					Indeed, when the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Thomas Bloodworth was woken up to be told
					about the fire, he replied "Pish! A woman might piss it out!". However that summer had
					been very hot and there had been no rain for weeks, so consequently the wooden houses 
					and buildings were tinder dry. The fire soon took hold: 300 houses quickly collapsed 
					and the strong east wind spread the flames further, jumping from house to house. The fire
					swept through the warren of streets lined with houses, the upper stories of which almost 
					touched across the narrow winding lanes. Efforts to bring the fire under control by using
					buckets quickly failed. Panic began to spread through the city. As the fire raged on, people
					tried to leave the city and poured down to the River Thames in an attempt to escape by boat. </p>

					<p>The 2012 Olympics is the third summer Games to be held in the city of London. London has hosted 
					summer Olympics twice before in 1908 and 1948 and with this year's Games the city will become the 
					first to host the modern Games thrice. 1908 Olympics: The 1908 Olympic Games were scheduled to take
					place in Rome, but the eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 7 April 1906 prompted the shifting of the Games 
					to London. 1948 Olympics: The 1948 Olympics was the first to be held after World War II, after the 
					1944 Games was cancelled due to the war.2012 Olympics: The 2012 Olympics will take place in London 
					between 27 July-12 August 2012. </p>

			<h2>Mindblowing facts</h2>
			<p>1. The Great Plague killed roughly a third of the entire population of Europe in the 15th Century,
			with London being particularly affected because of the narrow streets and lack of sanitation.</p>
			
			<p>2. London was devastated by the Great Fire in 1666 and the Blitz during the height of the Second World War, 
			with large parts of the city reduced to ruins. </p>
			
			<p>3. The Millennium Dome is the biggest structure of its kind in the world, so big that it can fit the Great 
			Pyramids of Giza comfortably under the roof! </p>
