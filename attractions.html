					<p>Buckingham Palace is the working headquarters of the Monarchy, where 
					the Queen carries out her official and ceremonial duties as Head of
					State of the United Kingdom and Head of the Commonwealth. The Queen
					and The Duke of Edinburgh live in the private apartments on the north 
					side of the Palace, while rooms on the upper floors of the north and east 
					sides are occupied by other members of the Royal Family. Much of the ground
					floor and the south wing of the Palace are used by Household staff. The principal
					State Rooms used for court ceremonies and official entertaining occupy the 
					main west block facing the gardens. </p>

					in 1886 to 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London
					and has become an iconic symbol of London. Tower Bridge is one of five London 
					bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust
					overseen by the City of London Corporation. </p>

					<p>Despite the Tower of London's grim reputation as a place of torture and death, 
					within these walls you will also discover the history of a royal palace, an armoury 
					and a powerful fortress. Don't miss Royal Beasts and learn about the wild and wonderous
					animals that have inhabited the Tower, making it the first London Zoo. Built in 1066 by 
					William the Conqueror, the Tower of London is one of the world's most famous fortresses
					and an imposing landmark on the banks of the River Thames. Nearly 1,000 years of history 
					is contained within the walls, and centuries-old myths and traditions of the Tower still
					survive to this day. The Tower of London welcomes visitors all year round, so book your 
					ticket in advance and immerse yourself in London's rich history. </p>
